#summary Compilation Instruction

= Requirements =

In order to compile OpenSMT you need autotools installed.


= Compile =

From the root directory of OpenSMT:

  * Generate configure
{{{
autoreconf --install (generates some files and configure)
}}}

  * Create a directory that will contain the object files and the executable, and change to it
{{{
mkdir build
cd build
}}}

  * Generate Makefiles and compile
{{{
../configure && make
}}}

You should find an executable = `opensmt` = in the same directory
