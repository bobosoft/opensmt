#summary How to build OpenSMT
#labels Featured,Phase-Deploy

= Requirements =

The current districution has been successfully compiled and tested under 
Linux and Mac. In order to compile OpenSMT you need: 
  * gcc/g++ >= 4.3.2
  * autotools
  * The [http://gmplib.org/ GNU Multiple Precision Library] installed

= Compile =

From the root directory of OpenSMT:

  * Generate configure
{{{
autoreconf --install (generates some files and directories. Use --force if you wish to overwrite)
}}}

  * Create a directory (e.g. build) that will contain the object files and the executable, and change into it
{{{
mkdir build
cd build
}}}

  * Generate Makefiles and compile
{{{
../configure && make
}}}

You should find an executable `opensmt` in the same directory.


= Special executables =

It is possible to generate special executables, by specifying command-line options to configure:

  * Debugging version: disables optimizations to allow assertion checking
{{{
../configure --disable-optimization
}}}

  * SMTCOMP version: no output, except sat/unsat/unknown. Optimizations are turned automatically on
{{{
../configure --enable-smtcomp
}}}

  * Profile version
{{{
../configure --enable-profiling
}}}

  * Pedantic assertion checking: enables certain SLOW sanity checks during execution. Optimizations must be turned off
{{{
../configure --enable-pedantic_debug --disable-optimization
}}}

  * External tool checking: each call to the theory part is checked against an external tool (you need to download "tool_wrapper.sh" and make sure it is inside a directory included in the PATH variable - not fully supported yet)
{{{
../configure --enable-external_tool --disable-optimization
}}}
