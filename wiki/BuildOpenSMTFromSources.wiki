#summary How to build OpenSMT
#labels compile,make,gcc,g,autotools,automake,configure

= Requirements =

In order to compile OpenSMT you need autotools installed.


= Compile =

From the root directory of OpenSMT:

  * Generate configure
{{{
autoreconf --install (generates some files and configure)
}}}

  * Create a directory that will contain the object files and the executable, and change to it
{{{
mkdir build
cd build
}}}

  * Generate Makefiles and compile
{{{
../configure && make
}}}

You should find an executable `opensmt` in the same directory.


= Special executable =

It is possible to generate special executables, by specifying command-line options to configure:

  * Debugging version
{{{
../configure --disable-optimization
}}}

  * SMTCOMP version
{{{
../configure --enable-smtcomp
}}}

  * Profile version
{{{
../configure --enable-profiling
}}}

  * Pedantic assertion checking (slow, optimizations must be turned off)
{{{
../configure --enable-pedantic_debug --disable-optimization
}}}
